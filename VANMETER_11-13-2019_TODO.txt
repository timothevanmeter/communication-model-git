TO DO File

******************************

Tasks to do:

001 - Create the setup and go procedures in the model with the name of the major procedures.
002 - Implement the alphabet for the individuals, its generation and subsequent modification, through mutation.
003 - Calculate the similarity ratio from the comparison of the two alphabets.
004 - Keep track of reproducing and non-reproducing individuals during each time step.
005 - Make all the procedures relating to alphabet and message length as general as possible: to allow any size of alphabet or message length to be selected by the user.
006 - Keep track of the type of individuals in the simulation: their 'alphabet identity'.
007 - Keep track of the number of possible types of individuals.
008 - Make a quick literature survey to explain the context for this type of model and the questions related to them.
009 - Obtain a general procedure to list all types of alphabets in the simulation and track their proportion through time.
010 - Automatize the workflow by using a awk script in combination with gnuplot to have all BehaviorSpace outputs directly plotted.
011 - Run simulations for an alphabet of size 4
012 - Implement new initialisations scenarios (potentially enabling aggregation)
013 - Integrate the aggregation index measure for agents in the main model

014 - Calculate temporal cross-correlation between individual's aggregation and population's size
015 - Do a regression model, using numerous simulations with changes in all parameters
016 - Run simulations to build a phase space for parameters of interest: parameters significant in the regression model
017 - Track individual agents to have a more detailed mechanistic understanding of the model's results
018 - Prove analytically that there is a convergence for the measure of similarity for any alphabet size
