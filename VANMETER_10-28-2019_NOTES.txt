Trying to make a general method for the creation of individual's alphabet of any size.

Solutioned the previous issue in a rather unelegant way, with a master list from which we subset the alphabet for each individual. This solution restricts the maximum alphabet's sizeto 36.

The individuals all possess an alphabet are able to move and die and now can meet, those encounters cna be monitored.\nNext step is to build the comparison between the two alphabets for two individuals.

**PROBLEM**
Because each turtles reports to a general function, when two turtles meet on a patch the interaction is counted two times, one time per turtle's perspective. I need to find a way of keeping in memory the agents that already were involved in a communication event.

The problem is solved! The interactions are possible and can be monitored, for now we have each agent printing its first alphabet letter to stdout.

The next step is the comparison of the alphabets.

The similarity ratio evaluation procedure functions! I visually screened the output printed to screen and all the cases for an alphabet of size 4 were respected: 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1. I am now gonna implement the reproduction procedure following this evaluation.

For now the whole model is working. The way message length is currently implemented is not satisfactory as we cannot have a message length greater than that of the alphabet size. But a more massive reevaluation of the code needs tobe done for this.

I found a more general way of creating an alphabet for each individual, which theoretically allow any size of alphabet to be produced. The next task would be to enable the color of the agents to match their alphabet identity, but this seems like a non-trivial task at the very least and a quite difficult one otherwise.
