TO DO File

******************************

Tasks to do:

001 - Create the setup and go procedures in the model with the name of the major procedures.
002 - Implement the alphabet for the individuals, its generation and subsequent modification, through mutation.
003 - Calculate the similarity ratio from the comparison of the two alphabets.
004 - Keep track of reproducing and non-reproducing individuals during each time step.
005 - Make all the procedures relating to alphabet and message length as general as possible: to allow any size of alphabet or message length to be selected by the user.
006 - Keep track of the type of individuals in the simulation: their 'alphabet identity'.
007 - Keep track of the number of possible types of individuals.

008 - Make a quick literature survey to explain the context for this type of model and the questions related to them.
009 - Obtain a general procedure to list all types of alphabets in the simulation and track their proportion through time.
010 - Automatize the workflow by using a awk script in combination with gnuplot to have all BehaviorSpace outputs directly plotted.
